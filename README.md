# Market_Research

This is a market research project based on a restaurants' database, it uses K-Means to classify restaurants according to various relvant features, and determines wether it's likely or not that they will be successful according to a Return Over Investement value.

For this, we used PCA to reduce the number of variables to visulaize the cluster,as well as K-means.
